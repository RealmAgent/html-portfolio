  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have learned in my career that I have a deep desire to be a champion for a product/service and help make people's
   work lives more effective and fulfilling. As an experienced IT professional and adept leader I have been able to implement
    this purpose throughout my career from a variety of perspectives. Those perspectives include roles like supervisor, product owner, 
    analyst, developer, and project manager. </p>

<p>I am working to become a Web Developer with deepened skill and expertise.</p>

<p>Ultimately I want to use these skills to serve others and make people's lives more fulfilled.</p>
