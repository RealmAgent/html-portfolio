    <h1>Top 3 Movies According to Kyle</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
    <hr/>
    <h3>Catch Me If You Can</h3>
    <p>Steven Spielberg at his best. Tom Hanks at his best. Leonardo Dicaprio at his best.</p>
    <p>The soundtrack is excilerating and moves the movie along at a riveting pace. The story constantly unfolds as Carol closes in on Frank, the con-man.</p>

    <h3>Knives Out</h3>
    <p>Daniel Craig's masterpiece performance. A fun mystery with a stellar cast and fun original story with twists and turns.</p>

    <h3>Bull Durham</h3>
    <p>If anything can capture the obsessive pull that sports can have on a man, it's this movie. </p> 
    <p>to the minor leagues, Crash Davis continues chasing the dream. The dream of improvement and validation in the form of a home run or a hard hit line drive. Maybe it's the ballpark or the locker room and traveling on the bus with the guys. It's all part of the allure of the game.</p>
